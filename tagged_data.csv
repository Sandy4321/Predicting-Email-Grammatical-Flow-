Hi sir,

<oi>I am Rajeev Pathak from IT System,and work their as Corporate Sales Executive(CSE).</oi> I have got the news that SuperBazaar is looking to upgrade its old inventory management computer systems. I have a brilliant idea of creating a machine perfectly suitable for your management computer systems. The new system will include rfid tracking device, display on screen each of the items scanned (i.e scanner), time of scan , price , item name etc of each of the item simultaneously at one time. We can also have the record of all items in the store and deduce the remaining item after each transaction is made.

 Besides this othr applications which already existed will be retrived in the record.

 The time estimate is: 20 days

 The cost estimate is: Rs.40,000



<cff>I hope you like the above mentioned attributes of the machine and I get your reply.
</cff>

Dera Sir,



<ow>Greeting for the day,</ow>



As Superbazaar is trying to upgrade itself in its IT functions and infrastructure, they approached us for this. They are specially asking for a better inventory management systems so that they can improve their performance in various hrizontals of the company.



As of our compnay, we would be the best player to enroll this project. Being a super rated firm for ITes services having more than 1000 clients and 40000 employees, IT systems can go rogue on this project making a healthy profit too.



Taking profit as an agenda for concern, IT systems can become core competitor in this scenario if it can deploy its RFID tracking system that improves tha logistics and compatibility of delivery systems tremendously. This technology is being used by most the courier companies to tag RFID products and then trace the exact location through our proprietary software called Isys.



We are spread over a number countries operating satisfyingly in Frunge(Bangladesh biggest fruit retailer) to Hexamoto (A high end sports bike manufacturer, Denmark).



We assure you, that you will be left with unexpected satisafction level with fringe benefits provided from our company.



We can build a healthy and concening relationship after all coming down with this deal.



<cff>Waiting eagerly for your revert.</cff>

Hello Parikshit,


<odf>
After refereing your case and upon investigation I came across to an issue that has been resolved at our end.</odf>

<op>

The inference based on that is, while you were accessing our cloud storage service and during registration the details provided by you were not according to the norms of the company. On furthr investigation the fault was thre at your address details provided.</op>



Also due to some technical problems at the back end the customer agents were unable to respond to your request instantaneously.

The service you were intended to use is the best offering of our company and is unique in the market with an online storage of 40 GB and guranteed to have 0% downtime which means no failure anytime, and I think that's the reason why to registered yourself for this service.

Email Body:



Dear Parikshit,



I appreciate your honest response to the unfolding of events regarding the purchase of TCloud. Let's look at your problem subjectively based on sequence of the events that took place.



<cap>I truly regret the inconvenience caused due to the 1 week delay in activating the subscription of the TCloud product</cap>. But it turns out that thre was some inconsistencies in the address entered by you, which led to the delay. So once you will provide us with the correct address, the subscription can be activated. <cap>I am sorry anyway for your inconvenience.
</cap>


<cap>Also, I am regretful for the inability to respond back to your complaint 2 days ago. </cap>The company employees are facing some workload crunch due to the enormous customerbase that the company has. And due to that your complaint couldn't be addressed. However, I will look into it that your complaint gets notified and brought into due notice.



As a part of the company policy I am offering you a 15 day free subscription period for TCloud apart from the 3 month subscription for which you have already paid as the compensation for your inconvenience. I hope that this will help you change the idea of refunding the subscription for TCloud.



<oi>Heaven Infotech is a successful IT and IT services based company. And TCloud is one of the company's most successful products. </oi><cff>And I guarantee you that you won't regret using our product in any way.</cff>

Thanks,

From your investigation within the company you found out that the activation was delayed because he peovided wrong address details in his application form.Howevwer ,the customer service agents failed to inform him about this.Also,they were unable to reply to the clints compliant 2 days ago because of sudden incrase in workload due to some technical glitches .Reply to the client on his email id,keeping in mind that it is stictly against company policy to return money to clients for services already used.

From your investigation within the company you found out 

that the activation was delayed because he provided wrong 

address details in his application form. However, this. Also, 

they were unable to reply to the client's complaint 2 days ago

because of sudden incress in workload due to some techincal

it is strictly against company ploicy to retrun money to client

Sir in order to hre some candidates we need to check their level of mind, so we need to conduct an aptitude test and comprehension test for their vocabulary.

We should set an eligibility criteria for them which i think should be at least 60% throughout with no running backs.

Email Body:

 

Hi Farhann,



<odf>It is been pleasure for our company that some of its well qualified candidates are going to get a good project and that too under the guidance of Vice president of our company.</odf>No doubt it will be a dream for every candidate to work for this project as they will get a lot of new things to learn while working with a highly experienced and honourable official of our company but according to the rules of our company,I would like to encounter some important information from you regarding hring process.

Firstly,is it compulsory for candidates to have a passport with them as you said they need to travel to Australia or company will take care of it because many candidates are coming from small towns and propably thre are very less chances of having a passport with them.

Secondly,is thre any interview session for candidates or direct hring will be done according to their statistics in the last three years.

Thrdly,is thre any possible chances of extension of duration of project timing as we have seen it happening most of the times and candidates then blame company for this,If thre is any possiblity of extension of time duration of project then do let me know about this so that candidates will get more clear imformation about project.

<cff>Kindly provide me with these imformations so that we can select better candidates for your project and can minimise any risk of error.</cff>

Hello Farhaan,



<odf>I am pleased at the highrate of growth of our company and as a HRA, the demand for more and more employees only projects itself as a positive sign in front of me.</odf>

I scanned through all the essential qualifications that a person must have to be a potential candidate for the post, however, thre are somethings I would like to bring to your notice before we can commence the recruitment process.

While you have mentioned that the applicant must have a 3-year experience in the area concerned, the detailed description of the type of project is missing. Furthr specifications would help us target a limited and an appropriate group.

Also, could you be a little more precise about the number of people to be recruited?

Hope to start the recruitment process soon. 

<cff>Awaiting your reply.</cff>

Hi Farhaan,



<ow>Hope this mail finds you well.</ow> In response to your mail regarding the recruitment of few people for a new project , I would like to bring certain things to your kind notice.



I already have applications of many graduated and post graduated intellectuals for the post of research interns in our Industrial research. However, apart from the information you stated, I would first like to know the technical requirements of the project so that I may shrtlist few of them for interview purpose on the basis of knowledge/expertise fields they have stated.

Interviews will help me evaluate them on the basis of their past experiences, research works and efficiency to work in your concerned arena.

Also, I wish to know if any stipend and accommodation would be provided to them by PRAGMATECH for their work duration.



I believe, with all above details in addition to information you already provided, I would be able to select right candidates for the concerned project so that their technical knowledge proves an asset for the company.

Dear Farhaan Sir,



<opc>As i have got an email from your side about hring a few people, i have done some of my assessments on this matter.
</opc>
We will have to make certain arrangements for some advertisement for the recruitment. We will have to find a place which provides a very common platform for those who aspire to get a job. May be a college campus will be suitable for this purpose.



As we are going to have it as soon as possible, we should start determining the pattern of the written exam as fast as we can. The group Discussion and personal interview will be conducted only after a candidate clears his/hr written exam. I will be conducting the personal interviews.Moreover, I will make my own team with some supporting staff and some experienced people to accompany me. 



Written exam must contain questions related to logical ability, aptitude and some verbal. the technical knowledge of a candidate must be more than an average.



<cdf>In the advertisement, we must clearly highlight that only those people who can manage to go Australia, are allowed to sit in the test to be conducted.

Since i have recently joined the company i am not much aware about the institutions whre genrally we hre people from so i would like to get a last of instutions whre we have been in past few years.



And I would like to know the dates you can give me for visiting the campus for recruitment,infact it would be of top most priority.Once i get the list of participating institutions i would tell you which of the dates are in sync with your dates since any othr company could be on the round or thre must not be any clash with any holiday.



I would also like to have the sample written examination papers of past years & would like to go through that papers once, we might be able to improvise the previous paper.



And most importantly what professional qualifications are to kept as benchmark

during recruitment process for this will be able to filter out the best proffesionals that are upto are requirements.



<cdf>I would like to know what is the package we would be offering to them & what post will be given to them this will furthr simplify the process.

</cdf>

Moreover, since they need to work in a team, they should know how to do so. They must be able to boost the morale of the fellow team members.

Hello Farhaan,

 

<opc> This is in regard of the Vacancy in a Project you mentioned in your previous Mail.</opc> Apart from the technical feasibility of a candidate we would be in grave need of having an insight of the person's background which would enable us to decide whethr he/she would suffice in the circumstances that would prevail in the work environment.

 From the past few months we've been getting many Job applications among whom I've stacked out a few fit for our checkpoints. As per our Company Directives we need our candidates to go through our usual HR assessment test detailing whethr person has problem leaving Country(Passport) or they have an open mind for working honestly open minded for an year which would run for an average of 2 hours and after a break of an hour would come the HR Interview whre an HR associate of ours would go through the practicality of person's skills in explicit manner basis of which would suffice whethr he/she is eligible. Also I would suggest queuing the HR Assessment after Technical Test as it would put our Resources to efficient use as may understand yourself.

<cff>Above mentioned criterion will make sure PragmaTech gets the best of the best for the Project and would touch new heights in the good books of us all.</cff>

Hi Farhaan,



<odf>Warm Greetings! </odf>

This is to bring to your kind attention that I acknowledged an email sent by you in the morning regarding the hring of the new candidates for the project that is supposedly scheduled for the entire next year and would commence in three months from now.



As you mentioned in the mail that project would possibly take place in Australia, i think we would need candidates who have at least an experience of five years who would be the best when it comes to dischrge the real duties at work. The reason as to why choose """"five"""" years experienced candidates, is a better presentation with better ideas coming forward which would surely contribute to make this project a success in itself without putting in much efforts and hence in turn we would get the best team to work upon the project.

 

Rest before we proceed with the hring of the new ones, we need to go through their entire academic record and personal records (passport/visa) as well for a brief view of their capabilities, so that we end up making teams for the domestic and international stations. Our company is of the leading company operating in the IT sector, so we would not want any of our core team member to lag behind. 

<cff>Looking forward to get your acknowledgement regarding the subject of new hring.</cff>

Hello Sir,

 <odf>We can start hring people as we have predefined structure ready with us. </odf>Once criteria gets match with structural requirements, we can easily move forward with smooth procedure of recruitment. But before this I want to ask some doubts. Here they are.

1. Which programming language for project is proposed by client ? 

2. How many project managers and core employes do we need ?

3. Do we provide them VISA if they haven't ?

4. What will be budget of the overall project ?

5. What if we are not able to find people having experience of three years ?

6. We have many skilled employees in Bangalore. Can we directly assign this project to few of them having nice record and experience with PRAGMATECH ?

7. Do they require any training before commencement of project ? if yes then what will be requirements and resources required by training procedures ?



 After this discussion we will be clear about project and we can proceed furthr.<ccd> If you have any query regarding these, you can e-mail me or it will be better if we can arrange meeting and fix some serious issues if any.

Sir,

<opc>Withreference to your e-mail regarding hring of candidates for your new project; before going on the hring process</opc>.I would like to gathr some information about the project which are listed as follows : 

1. Age group of candidates required.

2. Expected salary

3. Post project alternatives

4. Accomodation details (accomodation with spouse etc.)

5. Number of vacancies

6. Nature and Extent of Project

7. Project Description

8. Number of Maintenance Executives required

9. Designation of hred candidates



In addition to this, one more thing I would like to convey that on joining the company, I heard many things about the employee retainability of the organisation.

We hre our executives on temporary basis and just because of this, the experienced talent hesitates to join our company and thus we are degrading our name in terms of employee satisfaction.

<cdf>I would like to suggest you to take up this matter with the management and formulate certain options for the people working on a certain project to retain their job by eithr maintaining that project or switching over to a new project.
</cdf>

Email Body:

hi farhaan,

<opc> As you let me know the company is starting its new project for australia and for what we will have to hre few people.
</opc>
if it's possible i would like to recommend few of eligible current employees of our company's branch in Banglore.

i really want them to prove themeseles on this once in a life time opportunity because instead of hring from outside source, it's the best way to fulfill the requirements of the company.

it's my personal point of few but if you want to hre from othr sources then it's preety fine with me.

but before you take any decision over it, let me know so that we can mutually put our consent on it.

our company is dealing with 1,000 clients across the world and its annual revenue is greater than 100 million. so if go for ouside hring and look for suitable matches for this project then it's gonna be risky but yet we have to go for it as well.

so whatever decision you arre about to take let me know so that we can make furthr discussion over it and start the hring as soon as possible.

and if you have already shrt listed some candidates then forward their details so that we can check them on primarily criteria.

<cdf>i hope you wouldn't mind if i like to interact with them before making a final judgement on their selection.</cdf>

Dear Farhaan,



<odf>I like to hear the news that you will going to start new project. </odf>Now, for the hring the employees, first you need to clear about the strength that is how many employee you want for that project. Base on that you will put criteria. And also you have mentioned that you want employees who have atleast experience of 3 years and also are willing to travel in othr country. These two things are not enough for filtering criteria, you must specify the work type, area of interest and so on. Because with the help of such things, you will get the list of employees who are correct for the job that you will going to be give to them. If such conditions are clear and at the end of filtering process, if you get 40-45 employees list, then your task is greatly reduce and your resources are also not going to be wasted. I think these much information is enough for now and if you have any query regarding this process, please free feel to inform me.<ccd> I will help you out.</ccd>

<odf>As the well known IT consultancy. </odf>As we have built a network over the past 10 years and it's hoping to expand as on that line we reached a remarkable achievement. As one of our team leaded by Mr. Farhan has developed a new project which is based on the Management Tool and with their efforts and determination they managed to achieve a legendary target of deploying that software to our 1,000 customer yesterday.



As it is a moment of pride for whole organization and on their achievement. we are organizing an long hour session so that we can congratulate our team for their milestone and celebrate their happiness. Being an analyst i analysed the whole management tool software and it was a remarkable work by our team and its really helpful. This would not be possible without the help of our Sales Manager, Customer support executive and last but not the least consultants. These all made this project work in the market and now every company want our product. So We would be honoured with their presence in the celebration. 



<cff>So please join the ceremony of one hour long session held on next week at the main branch office.</cff>

Subject:Proposal for upgradation of inventory system at SuperBazaar



Email Body:



Dear Mr Pathak,



I understand that SuperBazaar is looking forward to replace the existing inventory management computer system by modern systems with RFID tracking and real time cost reporting.

<oi>

In this context, I would like to present our company, IT Systems, as an interested company to provide you with the required system. </oi>



We are a leader in the IT sector and have been delivering technology engineering and business consulting to more than 1000 clients across the world. Our Company is a pioneer in RFID tracking. We have developed the technology and software to apply and track upto 1 Million RFID tags. Our current clients, ranging from Frunge (Bangaldesh's biggest fruit retailer) to Hexamoto( a high end sports-bike manufacturer in Denmark), can track their items in real time using our proprietary software tool.



I am sure that given a chance to serve we would help you have the best RFID tracking system which would also be a huge competitive advantage for SuperBazaar as no major supermarket is currently using such advanced system.


<cac>
I would request you to provide the software requirements, technical constraints, project timeline and the budget details.</cac> This would help in understanding your requirements in a better and comprehensive manner. Also, the detailed cost and time estimates will also be communicated threafter.



<cff>Looking forward to your reply.</cff>

I have a brilliant idea of creating a machine perfectly suitable for your management computer systems.

We can also have the record of all items in the store and deduce the remaining item after each transaction is made.

 Besides this othr applications which already existed will be retrived in the record.

 The time estimate is: 20 days

 The cost estimate is: Rs.40,000

This technology is being used by most the courier companies to tag RFID products and then trace the exact location through our proprietary software called Isys.



We are spread over a number countries operating satisfyingly in Frunge(Bangladesh biggest fruit retailer) to Hexamoto (A high end sports bike manufacturer, Denmark).

Hello Parikshit,



<odf>After refereing your case and upon investigation I came across to an issue that has been resolved at our end.</odf>



The inference based on that is, while you were accessing our cloud storage service and during registration the details provided by you were not according to the norms of the company. On furthr investigation the fault was thre at your address details provided.



Also due to some technical problems at the back end the customer agents were unable to respond to your request instantaneously. 



Heaven Infotech is a premier organization an ecosystem which provides business consulting, technology, engineering, and outsourcing to more than 100 clients worldwide.



The service you were intended to use is the best offering of our company and is unique in the market with an online storage of 40 GB and guranteed to have 0% downtime which means no failure anytime, and I think that's the reason why to registered yourself for this service.

Our customer care representatives failed to get in touch with you and inform you about the discrepancy. We apologize for that. In addition, our customer care department was suffering from heavy workload and technical glitches for the last two days, due to which your feedback form was not received.

Greetings,



<opc>This is regarding your complaint for the activation of the cloud storage system.</opc> I have personally looked into the matter and found that the address given by you in the application form is incorrect. As a result, the customer service agents could not track down your address.

I have already directed them to process your complaint and you product will be activated by the evening. I would like to inform you that Heaven Infotech always guarantees 0% dowtime for Tcloud Store which means that this service never fails its customers. 

This is also to inform you that this is strictly against our company policy to return money to our clients for services already used. <cdf>I am attaching a copy of the application form which contains the in-correct address mentioned by you.</cdf>

Subject:Reg: Refund for TCloud

Email Body:



Dear Parikshit,



<odf>I appreciate your honest response to the unfolding of events regarding the purchase of TCloud.</odf> Let's look at your problem subjectively based on sequence of the events that took place.



I truly regret the inconvenience caused due to the 1 week delay in activating the subscription of the TCloud product. But it turns out that thre was some inconsistencies in the address entered by you, which led to the delay. So once you will provide us with the correct address, the subscription can be activated. I am sorry anyway for your inconvenience.



Also, I am regretful for the inability to respond back to your complaint 2 days ago. The company employees are facing some workload crunch due to the enormous customerbase that the company has. And due to that your complaint couldn't be addressed. However, I will look into it that your complaint gets notified and brought into due notice.



As a part of the company policy I am offering you a 15 day free subscription period for TCloud apart from the 3 month subscription for which you have already paid as the compensation for your inconvenience. I hope that this will help you change the idea of refunding the subscription for TCloud.



<cff>Heaven Infotech is a successful IT and IT services based company. And TCloud is one of the company's most successful products. And I guarantee you that you won't regret using our product in any way.</cff>

 I send your complaint at high priory so you get feedback of your complaint ,so get reply earlier;

First of all Sir I would like to tell you why your account on TCloud Store has not been activated. When your application form was being verified, your address for correspondence could not be verified. It may be because you have not given the correct address. Also our Customer Service Agent was unable to tell you about the same. Hence your account could not be activated within time.

On the othr hand I would like to remind to remind you that refund of money in any circumstances is not possible.

Hi Meenakshi,



<oi>I am Parikshit Sondhi,</oi>A week ago i purchased a 3 month subscription to your online data storage system.Ihave had a very hrrible experience with your company and Iwant to cancel my subscription. At the time of purchase I was promised that my service would be activated in 1 day ,however it's been 1 week and you still haven't activated my service .I complained about this 2 days ago using your feed back form but I did not receive a reply .You have behaved unprofessionally .Please return my money promptly othrwise I would have to go to the consumer court.



Thanks,

Parikshit Sondhi

From your investigation within the company you found out that the activation was delayed because he peovided wrong address details in his application form.Howevwer ,the customer service agents failed to inform him about this.Also,they were unable to reply to the clints compliant 2 days ago because of sudden incrase in workload due to some technical glitches .Reply to the client on his email id,keeping in mind that it is stictly against company policy to return money to clients for services already used.

Hi Parikshit,


<oi>
I am Meenakshi Aiyyar,Customer Sales Executive at Heaven Infotech,</oi>and I would like to tender my sincere apology on the behalf of the company for failure to promptly address your complain regarding delayed activation of your subscription for TCloud Store.The reason for this delay has been looked after by me with utmost professional etiquette.Its very disturbing to know that your belief in our company is shattered in the process and the concerned customer service agent have been suspended for replying late to your complaint.

Keeping in mind your good faith in us before the start of this episode,we would like to offer complete assistance,so that you can fill up your new application form and the details of the price to be chrged will be intimated to you as and when you apply for one.

<cap>Apologising again for the misunderstanding,we look forward to our continued and hrmonious relationship.</cap>

<oi>Dear customer, I am Meenakxi Aiyyar from the Heaven Infotech.</oi> I got your email today in which You seems to be unhappy with the product/service whihc you have bought. and you are asking for your money refund. 

 sir, firstly i want to tell you about Haven Infotech, It is an reputed IT compony which have annual revenue of rupees 20 crore and it have more than 100 clients across India. and the product which you have baught """"TCloud store"""" is the top and most successful product. It enables companies to backup, encript and shre their data within offices and amongst employees. 

 As you stated in your email that you havent got connection till now, on this problem I have concern with my team so the actual problem comes to know is you dont have given an correct adress. by the time of filling subscription form you filled it wrong address and our sales team went thre. and they coudent reply contact you since the didnt have your address. 

 Talking about your complaint which you have posted 2days ago, it is a pick period going on market, so due to sudden increase in workload our technical officer coudent reply on your complaint.

 Now i request you to give us correct address and the subcription will be activated within one day as you provide your address. 

 and I want to clear you one thing that by the policy of our compony it never allowed to give any kind of money refund at any situations to the customer.

Email Body:



Dear Sir,

<oa> Thank you vey much for your email regarding problem faced by you. I am very sorry for the trouble regarding activation of 'Cloud Storage System'.</oa>

 

 As promised at the time of purchase, activation is done within one day only. Whre as in your case as per my investigation it is found that the address details given in your application forms were wrong. However customer service agent failed to report to me. 



 Clients complaint two days ago were not resolved due to sudden increase in workload due to some technical glinches. 



 As per company's policy you are entiltled for refund of money. Still, I will insist to give consent for activation of services of Cloud Storage System. In future, we will not give you chance to complaint regarding service facilities to be provided from our side.



 Heaven Infotech is always at doorstep to provide services in IT sector. TCloud storage system will be very useful to your organization to take back up, encrypt and shre data with your offices and employee.



 If you are not happy and is interested in refund the amount will be deposited in bank account you have mentioned in the form. But I am confident and hopeful for positive responce for activation of Cloud Storage System. It has 0% downtime and it always satisfies the custome.



<cap> Once again sorry for the inconvenience to you.</cap>

 

 Thank you.

Hello Sir,

<ocg>First of all it is a very good news for us that we are going to start a new project and many congratulations to you sir.</ocg>.

Sir in order to hre some candidates we need to check their level of mind, so we need to conduct an aptitude test and comprehension test for their vocabulary.

We should set an eligibility criteria for them which i think should be at least 60% throughout with no running backs.

If thre were many students then we can shrt list them by conducting G.D and then next tests will be conducted.

On the basis of these results we can hre candidates those meet our requirements.

Firstly,is it compulsory for candidates to have a passport with them as you said they need to travel to Australia or company will take care of it because many candidates are coming from small towns and propably thre are very less chances of having a passport with them.

Secondly,is thre any interview session for candidates or direct hring will be done according to their statistics in the last three years.

Thrdly,is thre any possible chances of extension of duration of project timing as we have seen it happening most of the times and candidates then blame company for this,If thre is any possiblity of extension of time duration of project then do let me know about this so that candidates will get more clear imformation about project.

<cff>Kindly provide me with these imformations so that we can select better candidates for your project and can minimise any risk of error.</cff>

Dear Farhaan Sir,



<opc>As i have got an email from your side about hring a few people,</opc> i have done some of my assessments on this matter.

We will have to make certain arrangements for some advertisement for the recruitment. We will have to find a place which provides a very common platform for those who aspire to get a job. May be a college campus will be suitable for this purpose.



As we are going to have it as soon as possible, we should start determining the pattern of the written exam as fast as we can. The group Discussion and personal interview will be conducted only after a candidate clears his/hr written exam. I will be conducting the personal interviews.Moreover, I will make my own team with some supporting staff and some experienced people to accompany me. 



Written exam must contain questions related to logical ability, aptitude and some verbal. the technical knowledge of a candidate must be more than an average.



<cdf>In the advertisement, we must clearly highlight that only those people who can manage to go Australia, are allowed to sit in the test to be conducted.</cdf>

I would like to bring to your kind notice the various requirements one require before he/she could be selected to be a part of your upcoming project.As you need an person who has an experience of three or more years, so you must look for the company in which he was already working with plus the projects he has worked on so that you can very well identify the capabilities ,skills and deligence of the person in a particular arena.An edge should be given to those who was accounted for promotions in their previous company. While you are conducting the interview, you should analyze the confidence,team spirit and leadership qualities that person possess. Also the person should have the wit and will to adapt to any kind of circumstances. HE /She should be an asset to your company rathr than liabilty.The person should have good communication and most importantly technical skills. He/She should be good at programming level and could handle various languages at ease.Since you require the person to be comfortable while going to australia, so one should be accountable to travel across any corner of the world.He/She should be well versed with salary that you are going to offer them.Also the contract details must be crystal clear to them. 

Last but not the least ,after having a conversation with my colleagues and having their opinion i would like you to convey me about your company prospects in the future scenario so that i could tell you what all people want from a company and So that you can get the best recruiters from across the nation.

Hi Farhaan,



<opc>I was very pleased to see a mail from you showing your concern.</opc>



I have some questions inn my mind that i would like to put forward to you. 

Since i have recently joined the company i am not much aware about the institutions whre genrally we hre people from so i would like to get a last of instutions whre we have been in past few years.



And I would like to know the dates you can give me for visiting the campus for recruitment,infact it would be of top most priority.Once i get the list of participating institutions i would tell you which of the dates are in sync with your dates since any othr company could be on the round or thre must not be any clash with any holiday.



I would also like to have the sample written examination papers of past years & would like to go through that papers once, we might be able to improvise the previous paper.



And most importantly what professional qualifications are to kept as benchmark

during recruitment process for this will be able to filter out the best proffesionals that are upto are requirements.



<cdf>I would like to know what is the package we would be offering to them & what post will be given to them this will furthr simplify the process.</cdf>



Thank You

Since you require people who need to travel to Australia during the course of the project, hence they should be very good in communication skills. They should have a great personality and should have high self-confidence. They should have a great technical knowledge and must know how to use it effectively and efficiently. Moreover, since they need to work in a team, they should know how to do so. They must be able to boost the morale of the fellow team members.

Since you need people having an experience of more than 3 years, you must see to their earlier job profiles and their performance in their respective previous companies. Rest the company has full faith in you regarding the recruitment process. <cw>Hope your project is a huge success.</cw>

Email Body:

Hello Farhaan,

 

 <opc>This is in regard of the Vacancy in a Project you mentioned in your previous Mail.</opc> Apart from the technical feasibility of a candidate we would be in grave need of having an insight of the person's background which would enable us to decide whethr he/she would suffice in the circumstances that would prevail in the work environment.

 From the past few months we've been getting many Job applications among whom I've stacked out a few fit for our checkpoints. As per our Company Directives we need our candidates to go through our usual HR assessment test detailing whethr person has problem leaving Country(Passport) or they have an open mind for working honestly open minded for an year which would run for an average of 2 hours and after a break of an hour would come the HR Interview whre an HR associate of ours would go through the practicality of person's skills in explicit manner basis of which would suffice whethr he/she is eligible. Also I would suggest queuing the HR Assessment after Technical Test as it would put our Resources to efficient use as may understand yourself.

<cff>Above mentioned criterion will make sure PragmaTech gets the best of the best for the Project and would touch new heights in the good books of us all.</cff>

Thank You.

Subject: New Recruitments 

Email Body:



Hi Farhaan,



<ow>Warm Greetings!</ow> 

This is to bring to your kind attention that I acknowledged an email sent by you in the morning regarding the hring of the new candidates for the project that is supposedly scheduled for the entire next year and would commence in three months from now.



As you mentioned in the mail that project would possibly take place in Australia, i think we would need candidates who have at least an experience of five years who would be the best when it comes to dischrge the real duties at work. The reason as to why choose """"five"""" years experienced candidates, is a better presentation with better ideas coming forward which would surely contribute to make this project a success in itself without putting in much efforts and hence in turn we would get the best team to work upon the project.

 

Rest before we proceed with the hring of the new ones, we need to go through their entire academic record and personal records (passport/visa) as well for a brief view of their capabilities, so that we end up making teams for the domestic and international stations. Our company is of the leading company operating in the IT sector, so we would not want any of our core team member to lag behind. 

<cff>Looking forward to get your acknowledgement regarding the subject of new hring.</cff>

Hello Sir,

<odf> We can start hring people as we have predefined structure ready with us.</odf> Once criteria gets match with structural requirements, we can easily move forward with smooth procedure of recruitment. But before this I want to ask some doubts. Here they are.

1. Which programming language for project is proposed by client ? 

2. How many project managers and core employes do we need ?

3. Do we provide them VISA if they haven't ?

4. What will be budget of the overall project ?

5. What if we are not able to find people having experience of three years ?

6. We have many skilled employees in Bangalore. Can we directly assign this project to few of them having nice record and experience with PRAGMATECH ?

7. Do they require any training before commencement of project ? if yes then what will be requirements and resources required by training procedures ?



 After this discussion we will be clear about project and we can proceed furthr. <ccd>If you have any query regarding these, you can e-mail me or it will be better if we can arrange meeting and fix some serious issues if any.</ccd>

We hre our executives on temporary basis and just because of this, the experienced talent hesitates to join our company and thus we are degrading our name in terms of employee satisfaction.

<odf> As you let me know the company is starting its new project for australia and for what we will have to hre few people.</odf>

if it's possible i would like to recommend few of eligible current employees of our company's branch in Banglore.

i really want them to prove themeseles on this once in a life time opportunity because instead of hring from outside source, it's the best way to fulfill the requirements of the company.

it's my personal point of few but if you want to hre from othr sources then it's preety fine with me.

but before you take any decision over it, let me know so that we can mutually put our consent on it.

our company is dealing with 1,000 clients across the world and its annual revenue is greater than 100 million. so if go for ouside hring and look for suitable matches for this project then it's gonna be risky but yet we have to go for it as well.

so whatever decision you arre about to take let me know so that we can make furthr discussion over it and start the hring as soon as possible.

and if you have already shrt listed some candidates then forward their details so that we can check them on primarily criteria.

<cdf>i hope you wouldn't mind if i like to interact with them before making a final judgement on their selection.</cdf>

These two things are not enough for filtering criteria, you must specify the work type, area of interest and so on. Because with the help of such things, you will get the list of employees who are correct for the job that you will going to be give to them. If such conditions are clear and at the end of filtering process, if you get 40-45 employees list, then your task is greatly reduce and your resources are also not going to be wasted. <ccd>I think these much information is enough for now and if you have any query regarding this process, please free feel to inform me.

Subject:Information regarding candidates

Email Body:



Hi Farhaan,



<opc>I received your mail yesterday, and was very happy to hear that you are starting a new project.</opc> I started to think about the possible candidate's information that would be required for the same. First of all, how many candidates do you require?Also, should the experience of the candidate be in some specific technical field? How frequently will be the visits to Australia along with its duration? Do you want some age limit to your candidates? How much stipend should they expect with this job?Lastly, are you looking for more of a team player or the work would be more individual based? 

<cff>Hope you would reply me at your earliest convinience.</cff>



Thanks

Hello,

<odf>As the well known IT consultancy</odf>. As we have built a network over the past 10 years and it's hoping to expand as on that line we reached a remarkable achievement. As one of our team leaded by Mr. Farhan has developed a new project which is based on the Management Tool and with their efforts and determination they managed to achieve a legendary target of deploying that software to our 1,000 customer yesterday.



As it is a moment of pride for whole organization and on their achievement. we are organizing an long hour session so that we can congratulate our team for their milestone and celebrate their happiness. Being an analyst i analysed the whole management tool software and it was a remarkable work by our team and its really helpful. This would not be possible without the help of our Sales Manager, Customer support executive and last but not the least consultants. These all made this project work in the market and now every company want our product. So We would be honoured with their presence in the celebration. 



So please join the ceremony of one hour long session held on next week at the main branch office.

This technology is being used by most the courier companies to tag RFID products and then trace the exact location through our proprietary software called Isys.



We are spread over a number countries operating satisfyingly in Frunge(Bangladesh biggest fruit retailer) to Hexamoto (A high end sports bike manufacturer, Denmark).

Hi Parikshit,



<opc>On receiving your email, I immediately asked my team to investigate as to why your service has not been activated till yet. 
</opc>


On investigating we found out that your service activation was delayed because the address details provided in your application form were incorrect. The customer service agent could not inform you about this as they tried calling on your mobile and it was not reachable. <oa>From the past three days thre has been a sudden increase in workload due to technical glitches so the customer service agents could not reply to your complaint.</oa>



<oa>I extend an apology on the behalf of my company for the inconvenience caused to you.</oa> <cac>I request you to kindly send me your address details.</cac> I would personally make sure that your details get updated in our database. <ccd>I assure you that your service would be activated within five hours as soon as you provide us the details.</ccd>



<oi>Our cloud storage system- TCloud is very robust and it is guaranteed to have 0% downtime which means that service never fails to its customers. The 100 clients that we serve are extremely satisfied with the services that we provide.</oi> It was unfortunate that your service could not activated. 



<oa>I assure you that we will not give you a chance to complain again. Once your service is activated you would be glad to have chosen our service.</oa>



<cac>Kindly send me your address details at the earliest.</cac>

Hello Parikshit,



<opc>After refereing your case and upon investigation I came across to an issue that has been resolved at our end.</opc>



The inference based on that is, while you were accessing our cloud storage service and during registration the details provided by you were not according to the norms of the company. On furthr investigation the fault was thre at your address details provided.



Also due to some technical problems at the back end the customer agents were unable to respond to your request instantaneously.

Email Body:



Dear Parikshit,



<odf>I appreciate your honest response to the unfolding of events regarding the purchase of TCloud.</odf> Let's look at your problem subjectively based on sequence of the events that took place.



<oa>I truly regret the inconvenience caused due to the 1 week delay in activating the subscription of the TCloud product.</oa> But it turns out that thre was some inconsistencies in the address entered by you, which led to the delay. So once you will provide us with the correct address, the subscription can be activated. <oa>I am sorry anyway for your inconvenience.</oa>



<oa>Also, I am regretful for the inability to respond back to your complaint 2 days ago. </oa>The company employees are facing some workload crunch due to the enormous customerbase that the company has. And due to that your complaint couldn't be addressed. However, I will look into it that your complaint gets notified and brought into due notice.



As a part of the company policy I am offering you a 15 day free subscription period for TCloud apart from the 3 month subscription for which you have already paid as the compensation for your inconvenience<ccd>. I hope that this will help you change the idea of refunding the subscription for TCloud.</ccd>



Heaven Infotech is a successful IT and IT services based company. And TCloud is one of the company's most successful products.<cdf> And I guarantee you that you won't regret using our product in any way.

Among othrs, TCloud enables companies to backup, encrypt and shre their data within their offices and amongst employees. It is guaranteed to have 0% downtime which means that this service never fails its customers.

On the othr hand I would like to remind to remind you that refund of money in any circumstances is not possible.

Dear Mr. Parikshit,



<odf>I have looked into the matter you have been complaining about and found out a few facts that led to your dissatisfaction.</odf>



1. The address that you had provided to us in your application form was incorrect.

 This was the reason behind delay of activation of your subscription. Unfortunately the customer service agents could not contact you and this led to your dissentment.



2. Secondly sir we were unable to process your complaint lodged two days ago because of some sudden increase in workload due to some unexpected technical glitches.



<cac>Withregard to the above facts that I have already mentioned I would like to request you rectify your address in the application form and I assure you that such a problem will not occur again. </cac>As far as the product TCloud Store remains it is one of the best and fail safe product of our company Heaven Infotech. TCloud Infotech still guarantees that it has 0% downtime and never fails its customers. Furthrmore it is against the company policy to repay for products sold but I ensure you that once now that you will start using our product with all its features you will relish it and returning the product will be out of your thoughts.

<cap>Once again I would like to apologize for whatever pains you had to suffer on behalf of our product</cap> and expect you to give our product a fair try now that all errors on both our behalves are being corrected.

Dear Sir,

<opc> Thank you vey much for your email regarding problem faced by you</opc>.<oa> I am very sorry for the trouble regarding activation of 'Cloud Storage System'.</oa>

 

 As promised at the time of purchase, activation is done within one day only. Whre as in your case as per my investigation it is found that the address details given in your application forms were wrong. However customer service agent failed to report to me. 



 Clients complaint two days ago were not resolved due to sudden increase in workload due to some technical glinches. 



 As per company's policy you are entiltled for refund of money. <ccd>Still, I will insist to give consent for activation of services of Cloud Storage System.</ccd> In future, we will not give you chance to complaint regarding service facilities to be provided from our side.



 Heaven Infotech is always at doorstep to provide services in IT sector. TCloud storage system will be very useful to your organization to take back up, encrypt and shre data with your offices and employee.



 If you are not happy and is interested in refund the amount will be deposited in bank account you have mentioned in the form. But I am confident and hopeful for positive responce for activation of Cloud Storage System. It has 0% downtime and it always satisfies the custome.

Hi meenakshi,



I am Parikashit Sondhi.<opc>A week ago I purchased a 3 month 

subscription to your online data storage system.</opc> I have had

a very hrrible experience with your company and I want to

cancel my subscription. At the time of purchase I was promised

that my sevice would be activated in 1 day, however it's been 1 

week and you still have notactivated my service. I complained 

about this 2 day ago using your feedback from but I did not receive

 a reply. You have behaved unprofessionally. Please return

my mony promptly othrwise I would have to go to the consumer

court.



Thanks

Parikshit Sondhi



From your investigation within the company you found out 

that the activation was delayed because he provided wrong 

address details in his application form. However, this. Also, 

they were unable to reply to the client's complaint 2 days ago

because of sudden incress in workload due to some techincal

glitches. Reply to the client on his email id, keeping in mind that

it is strictly against company ploicy to retrun money to client

forservices already used.

Sir in order to hre some candidates we need to check their level of mind, so we need to conduct an aptitude test and comprehension test for their vocabulary.

We should set an eligibility criteria for them which i think should be at least 60% throughout with no running backs.

If thre were many students then we can shrt list them by conducting G.D and then next tests will be conducted.

On the basis of these results we can hre candidates those meet our requirements.

In my opinion this recruitment process will be enough to get good candidates for our company, please make the amendments whrever required.

Hi Farhann,


<odf>
It is been pleasure for our company</odf> that some of its well qualified candidates are going to get a good project and that too under the guidance of Vice president of our company.No doubt it will be a dream for every candidate to work for this project as they will get a lot of new things to learn while working with a highly experienced and honourable official of our company but according to the rules of our company,I would like to encounter some important information from you regarding hring process.

Firstly,is it compulsory for candidates to have a passport with them as you said they need to travel to Australia or company will take care of it because many candidates are coming from small towns and propably thre are very less chances of having a passport with them.

Secondly,is thre any interview session for candidates or direct hring will be done according to their statistics in the last three years.

Thrdly,is thre any possible chances of extension of duration of project timing as we have seen it happening most of the times and candidates then blame company for this,If thre is any possiblity of extension of time duration of project then do let me know about this so that candidates will get more clear imformation about project.

<cac>Kindly provide me with these imformations</cac> so that we can select better candidates for your project and can minimise any risk of error.



<cth>Thanks

Hello Farhaan,



<odf>I am pleased at the highrate of growth of our company</odf> and as a HRA, the demand for more and more employees only projects itself as a positive sign in front of me.

I scanned through all the essential qualifications that a person must have to be a potential candidate for the post, however, thre are somethings I would like to bring to your notice before we can commence the recruitment process.

While you have mentioned that the applicant must have a 3-year experience in the area concerned, the detailed description of the type of project is missing. Furthr specifications would help us target a limited and an appropriate group.

Also, could you be a little more precise about the number of people to be recruited?

Hope to start the recruitment process soon. 

<cff>Awaiting your reply.</cff>

I already have applications of many graduated and post graduated intellectuals for the post of research interns in our Industrial research. However, apart from the information you stated, I would first like to know the technical requirements of the project so that I may shrtlist few of them for interview purpose on the basis of knowledge/expertise fields they have stated.

Interviews will help me evaluate them on the basis of their past experiences, research works and efficiency to work in your concerned arena.

Also, I wish to know if any stipend and accommodation would be provided to them by PRAGMATECH for their work duration.



I believe, with all above details in addition to information you already provided, I would be able to select right candidates for the concerned project so that their technical knowledge proves an asset for the company.

Dear Farhaan Sir,



<opc>As i have got an email from your side about hring a few people, i have done some of my assessments on this matter.
</opc>
We will have to make certain arrangements for some advertisement for the recruitment. We will have to find a place which provides a very common platform for those who aspire to get a job. May be a college campus will be suitable for this purpose.



As we are going to have it as soon as possible, we should start determining the pattern of the written exam as fast as we can. The group Discussion and personal interview will be conducted only after a candidate clears his/hr written exam. I will be conducting the personal interviews.Moreover, I will make my own team with some supporting staff and some experienced people to accompany me. 



Written exam must contain questions related to logical ability, aptitude and some verbal. the technical knowledge of a candidate must be more than an average.



In the advertisement, we must clearly highlight that only those people who can manage to go Australia, are allowed to sit in the test to be conducted.

 Also you need to let me know the pay scale you are looking to offer to the employees.I also want to know some what about the project so that it could be easier for me to go and hre the employees.To be more precise follow these points and provide me the following information.



1. Details about the project.

4. Medical requirements.

5.Pay scale.

6.Details of Bond agreement.

Since i have recently joined the company i am not much aware about the institutions whre genrally we hre people from so i would like to get a last of instutions whre we have been in past few years.



And I would like to know the dates you can give me for visiting the campus for recruitment,infact it would be of top most priority.Once i get the list of participating institutions i would tell you which of the dates are in sync with your dates since any othr company could be on the round or thre must not be any clash with any holiday.



I would also like to have the sample written examination papers of past years & would like to go through that papers once, we might be able to improvise the previous paper.



And most importantly what professional qualifications are to kept as benchmark

during recruitment process for this will be able to filter out the best proffesionals that are upto are requirements.



I would like to know what is the package we would be offering to them & what post will be given to them this will furthr simplify the process.

Email Body:

Hello Farhaan,

 
<opc>
 This is in regard of the Vacancy in a Project you mentioned in your previous Mail. </opc>Apart from the technical feasibility of a candidate we would be in grave need of having an insight of the person's background which would enable us to decide whethr he/she would suffice in the circumstances that would prevail in the work environment.

 From the past few months we've been getting many Job applications among whom I've stacked out a few fit for our checkpoints. As per our Company Directives we need our candidates to go through our usual HR assessment test detailing whethr person has problem leaving Country(Passport) or they have an open mind for working honestly open minded for an year which would run for an average of 2 hours and after a break of an hour would come the HR Interview whre an HR associate of ours would go through the practicality of person's skills in explicit manner basis of which would suffice whethr he/she is eligible. Also I would suggest queuing the HR Assessment after Technical Test as it would put our Resources to efficient use as may understand yourself.

Above mentioned criterion will make sure PragmaTech gets the best of the best for the Project and would touch new heights in the good books of us all.

If a lot of candidates, beyond our expectations applied for this post so eithr put a common test or a GD round in order to point out the best one.

The candidate must be Graduate/Post graduate in any Disciple with a regular college Degree with atleast 55% in garduation and atleast 50% in PG.

He/She should be best in communication skill and must possess positive attitude with shine in his/hr eyes. 

As the candidate have to travel Australia so it must be obvious that he/she should be best representative of our country and should be better than best communicator.

And rest of the things are in yours hand, as you know about our company status so you have to select who suits our company best and not those who just wana to enter in a good company.

Email Body:



Hi Farhaan,



Warm Greetings! 

<op>This is to bring to your kind attention that I acknowledged an email sent by you in the morning </op>regarding the hring of the new candidates for the project that is supposedly scheduled for the entire next year and would commence in three months from now.



As you mentioned in the mail that project would possibly take place in Australia, i think we would need candidates who have at least an experience of five years who would be the best when it comes to dischrge the real duties at work. The reason as to why choose """"five"""" years experienced candidates, is a better presentation with better ideas coming forward which would surely contribute to make this project a success in itself without putting in much efforts and hence in turn we would get the best team to work upon the project.

 

Rest before we proceed with the hring of the new ones, we need to go through their entire academic record and personal records (passport/visa) as well for a brief view of their capabilities, so that we end up making teams for the domestic and international stations. Our company is of the leading company operating in the IT sector, so we would not want any of our core team member to lag behind. 

Looking forward to get your acknowledgement regarding the subject of new hring.

Hello Sir,
<odf>
 We can start hring people as we have predefined structure ready with us.</odf> Once criteria gets match with structural requirements, we can easily move forward with smooth procedure of recruitment. But before this I want to ask some doubts. Here they are.

1. Which programming language for project is proposed by client ? 

2. How many project managers and core employes do we need ?

3. Do we provide them VISA if they haven't ?

4. What will be budget of the overall project ?

5. What if we are not able to find people having experience of three years ?

6. We have many skilled employees in Bangalore. Can we directly assign this project to few of them having nice record and experience with PRAGMATECH ?

7. Do they require any training before commencement of project ? if yes then what will be requirements and resources required by training procedures ?



 After this discussion we will be clear about project and we can proceed furthr. If you have any query regarding these, you can e-mail me or it will be better if we can arrange meeting and fix some serious issues if any.

Sir,

<opc>Withreference to your e-mail regarding hring of candidates for your new project; before going on the hring process</opc>.I would like to gathr some information about the project which are listed as follows : 

1. Age group of candidates required.

2. Expected salary

3. Post project alternatives

4. Accomodation details (accomodation with spouse etc.)

5. Number of vacancies

6. Nature and Extent of Project

8. Number of Maintenance Executives required

9. Designation of hred candidates



In addition to this, one more thing I would like to convey that on joining the company, I heard many things about the employee retainability of the organisation.

We hre our executives on temporary basis and just because of this, the experienced talent hesitates to join our company and thus we are degrading our name in terms of employee satisfaction.

I would like to suggest you to take up this matter with the management and formulate certain options for the people working on a certain project to retain their job by eithr maintaining that project or switching over to a new project.

hi farhaan,
<cdf>
 As you let me know the company is starting its new project for australia and for what we will have to hre few people.</cdf>

if it's possible i would like to recommend few of eligible current employees of our company's branch in Banglore.

i really want them to prove themeseles on this once in a life time opportunity because instead of hring from outside source, it's the best way to fulfill the requirements of the company.

it's my personal point of few but if you want to hre from othr sources then it's preety fine with me.

but before you take any decision over it, let me know so that we can mutually put our consent on it.

our company is dealing with 1,000 clients across the world and its annual revenue is greater than 100 million. so if go for ouside hring and look for suitable matches for this project then it's gonna be risky but yet we have to go for it as well.

so whatever decision you arre about to take let me know so that we can make furthr discussion over it and start the hring as soon as possible.

and if you have already shrt listed some candidates then forward their details so that we can check them on primarily criteria.

i hope you wouldn't mind if i like to interact with them before making a final judgement on their selection.

Dear Farhaan,


<odf>
I like to hear the news that you will going to start new project.</odf> Now, for the hring the employees, first you need to clear about the strength that is how many employee you want for that project. Base on that you will put criteria. And also you have mentioned that you want employees who have atleast experience of 3 years and also are willing to travel in othr country. These two things are not enough for filtering criteria, you must specify the work type, area of interest and so on. Because with the help of such things, you will get the list of employees who are correct for the job that you will going to be give to them. If such conditions are clear and at the end of filtering process, if you get 40-45 employees list, then your task is greatly reduce and your resources are also not going to be wasted. I think these much information is enough for now and<ccd> if you have any query regarding this process, please free feel to inform me. I will help you out.

Dear Farhaan,



As far as our project is concerned, you told that employees should have willingness to go Australia during this project, So My suggestion is that we should hre the people who have job(project) experience of at least 6 months in out of country most probably in Australia. It is beneficial to those employees and our company too. Since it is new project and totally belongs to new employees, we should hre people with 5 years experience in any IT company or we can hre one person with 5 years experience as team leader and for othrs same like as you said.

So these are some suggestion from my side which I wanted to tell you.
